			<b>History of Bangladesh</b><br />
			Bangladesh is known as an independent country in 1971 after achieving independent from Pakistan in the Liberation War.
			The borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the partition of Bengal and India in August 1947, when the region 
			became East Pakistan as a part of the newly formed State of Pakistan following the Radcliffe Line. It was separated from 
			West Pakistan by 1,600 km (994mi) of Indian Territory. The British East India Company gained official control of Bengal 
			following the Battle of Plassey in 1757. In 1858, authority in India was transferred from the Company to the crown, and 
			the rebellion was brutally suppressed. Rule of India was organized under a Viceroy and continued a pattern of economic 
			exploitation. The Bengali Language Movement, also known as the Language Movement Bhasha Andolon, was a political effort 
			in Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan), advocating the recognition of the Bengali language as an official language 
			of Pakistan. When the state of Pakistan was formed in 1947, its two regions, East Pakistan (also called East Bengal) and 
			West Pakistan, were split along cultural, geographical, and linguistic lines. In 1948, the Government of Pakistan ordained 
			Urdu as the sole national language, sparking extensive protests among the Bengali-speaking majority of East Pakistan. The 
			students of the University of Dhaka and other political activists defined the law and organized a protest on 21 February 
			1952. The movement reached its climax when police killed student demonstrators on that day. The deaths provoked widespread 
			civil unrest led by the Awami Muslim League, later renamed the Awami League. After years of conflict, the central government
			relented and granted official status to the Bengali language in 1956. The On 17 November 1999, UNESCO declared 21 February
			International Mother Language Day for the whole world to celebrate. After the Awami League won all the East Pakistan seats 
			as well as majority of the Pakistanâ€™s National Assembly in the 1970-71 elections, West Pakistan opened talks with the East 
			on constitutional questions about the division of power between the central government and the provinces, as well as the 
			formation of a national government headed by the Awami League. The talks proved unsuccessful, however, and on March 1, 1971,
			Pakistani President Yahya Khan indefinitely postponed the pending National Assembly session, precipitating massive civil 
			disobedience in East Pakistan. On March 2, 1971, a group of students, led by A S M Abdur Rob, student leader & VP of DUCSU 
			(Dhaka University Central Students Union) raised the new (proposed) flag of Bangladesh under the direction of Swadhin Bangla
			Nucleus. Rather he decided that he will declare his next steps on March 7 public meeting. On March 3, 1971, student leader 
			Shahjahan Siraj read the 'Sadhinotar Ishtehar' (Declaration of independence) at Paltan Maidan in front of Bangabandhu Sheikh
			Mujib along with student and public gathering under the direction of Swadhin Bangla Nucleus. On March 7, there was a historical 
			public gathering in Suhawardy Udyan to hear updates on the ongoing movement from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib, the frontier leader 
			of movement that time. Although he avoided the direct speech of independence as the talks were still underway, he influenced the
			mob to prepare for any imminent war. The speech is considered a key moment in the war of liberation, and is remembered for the
			phrase, "Ebarer Shongram Amader Muktir Shongram, Ebarer Shongram Shadhinotar Shongram....".
